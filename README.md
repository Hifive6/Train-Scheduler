This app also introduces you with a another cdn moment to help add time and dates into application that can be built. The biggest idea that this application is trying to convene is this persistance where when you refresh or navigate to other websites and return that information that was input can be stored on a server somewhere.

The application  will do the math for you and tell you relative to current till when the next time will be arriving and how long in minutes till the next train stop, while keeping any existing add information current and to do date.
